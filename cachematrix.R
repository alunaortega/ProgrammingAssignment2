## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly 
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here).
## Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special “matrix” object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    s <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        s <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setSolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
    getSolve <- function() s
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setSolve = setSolve,
         getSolve = getSolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special “matrix” returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    s <- x$getSolve()
    if(!is.null(s)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(s)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    s <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setSolve(s)
    s
}
